mViewer(Micro/Mongo Viewer) is a light (read web based like Futon for couchdb) GUI for mongo db which does not need any install steps.

Current Features are:

   1. Managed db and collections (usual add/drop of collections and drop of db)
   2. Viewing collection and db stats (count, size, storage et al)
   3. query executor
   4. Mongo stats


How to Build

Run build.xml using ant, target is dist. Since the default target is also set as dist, just running ant should suffice. dist would create a deployable war in the staging directory, which by default is at the same level as the src folder.

This war can be deployed on any servlet spec 3.0 compliant server like jboss as 6.

How to run
Once the war is deployed go to the url http://<server-ip>:<http-port>/mViewer

login to the mongo system, on your machine or any other visible location.


How to create test data (from outside the tool)
create a db (unlike other dbs mongo creates a new db as soon as we do a insert)
# use mvTest

Create a collection on the db
#db.createCollection("bugs", {capped:true, size:100000})

Insert two docs into the db
#bug = {author:'AN', created: new Date(), title:'UI issues'}
#db.bugs.insert(bug)
#bug.title = 'Usability issues'
#db.bugs.insert(bug)

update one of the docs to add an embedded document, in this example we added comments to the 'UI issues' bug
#db.bugs.update({title:'UI issues'}, {$addToSet : {comments: {text: 'Worked today', created:new Date()}}})

Adding one more comment to bugs (example of adding an embedded document)
#db.bugs.update({title:'UI issues'}, {$addToSet : {comments: {text: 'Completed', created:new Date()}}})

query on base of the embedded document
#db.bugs.find({'comments.text' : 'Worked today'})
